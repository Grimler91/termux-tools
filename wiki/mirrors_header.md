# Info for mirror maintainers

On `10th` of December `2022` we moved the primary termux packages repository (https://packages.termux.dev) from FossHost to [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). Now the repository is accessible over both IPv4 and IPv6, and `rsync` can be used to mirror the main repository. The page [How to mirror the official repositories](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/How-to-mirror-the-official-repositories) has suggestions for how to mirror our repositories.

The `unstable-packages`, `game-packages` and `science-packages` channels have been merged into the `termux-main` channel and do not need to be synced any longer.

* Mirror Size (full): 27.57GB (as of June 2025)

# Repositories and Mirrors

Termux packages, except bootstrap environment, are served via external web services. There is a primary package server (seed) and number or mirrors, which replicate the content from it to reduce load and provide a some level of redundancy. Mirrors are running either on behalf of maintainers, community members or unaffiliated third parties and are not guaranteed to be always available.

Packages require Termux running on Android 7.0 or higher. Do not try to use repositories listed there on legacy environments.

Service availability may vary depending on your device, Internet connection quality, and censorship events in your country. If we detect serious issue on our side, we will post announce on GitHub and our community pages. Other issues, like introduced on client side or somewhere between endpoints, would be ignored.

## How to use

Run `apt edit-sources`, comment out existing URLs and add line for picked repository, or use the `termux-change-repo` script that is part of the `termux-tools` package. The mirrors provided by `termux-tools` package are specified at https://github.com/termux/termux-tools/tree/master/mirrors.

## Primary host

A default Termux packages repository and content seeder for available mirrors.

| Repository                                             | sources.list entry                                            |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Main](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages)      | `deb https://packages.termux.dev/apt/termux-main stable main` |
| [Root](https://github.com/termux/termux-root-packages) | `deb https://packages.termux.dev/apt/termux-root root stable` |
| [X11](https://github.com/termux/x11-packages)          | `deb https://packages.termux.dev/apt/termux-x11 x11 main`     |

CloudFlare CDN endpoint. Fast and stable, but has limits on uploads 100MB max per POST in "free" plan) which makes impossible to use it or submitting packages via GitHub Actions + Aptly REST API.

| Repository                                             | sources.list entry                                               |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Main](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages)      | `deb https://packages-cf.termux.dev/apt/termux-main stable main` |
| [Root](https://github.com/termux/termux-root-packages) | `deb https://packages-cf.termux.dev/apt/termux-root root stable` |

Please don't use our host in termux forks. Set up your own repository. Otherwise consider to contribute to our project instead of maintaining the custom fork.

## Mirrors

There are listed all known Termux mirrors. If you hosted one but didn't find it in the list, please open the issue in https://github.com/termux/termux-tools/issues.

### Mirrors that are part of mirror rotation in pkg

These mirrors (listed alphabetically) might be picked, on random, when pkg checks available mirrors and picks one.
